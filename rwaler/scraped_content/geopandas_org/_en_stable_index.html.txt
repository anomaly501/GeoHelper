GeoPandas 1.1.1
#
GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial
data in python easier.  GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by
pandas
to allow spatial operations on geometric types.  Geometric
operations are performed by
shapely
.  Geopandas further depends on
pyogrio
for file access and
matplotlib
for plotting.
Description
#
The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in
python easier.  It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely,
providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface
to multiple geometries to shapely.  GeoPandas enables you to easily do
operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database
such as PostGIS.
