#
Return a
Series
of
dtype('bool')
with value
True
for
each aligned geometry disjoint to
other
.
An object is said to be disjoint to
other
if its
boundary
and
interior
does not intersect at all with those of the other.
The operation works on a 1-to-1 row-wise manner:
Parameters
:
other
GeoSeries or geometric object
The GeoSeries (elementwise) or geometric object to test if is
disjoint.
align
bool | None (default None)
If True, automatically aligns GeoSeries based on their indices.
If False, the order of elements is preserved. None defaults to True.
Returns
:
Series (bool)

GeoSeries.touches
Notes
This method works in a row-wise manner. It does not check if an element
of one GeoSeries is equal to
any
element of the other one.

We can check each geometry of GeoSeries to a single
geometry:
>>>
line
=
LineString
([(
0
,
0
),
(
2
,
0
)])
>>>
s
.
disjoint
(
line
)
0    False
1    False
2    False
3     True
dtype: bool
We can also check two GeoSeries against each other, row by row.
We can either align both GeoSeries
based on index values and compare elements with the same index using
align=True
or ignore index and compare elements based on their matching
order using
align=False
