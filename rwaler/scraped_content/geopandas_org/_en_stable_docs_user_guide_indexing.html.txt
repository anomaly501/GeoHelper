Indexing and selecting data
Indexing and selecting data
#
GeoPandas inherits the standard
pandas
methods for indexing/selecting data. This includes label based indexing with
loc
and integer position based indexing with
iloc
, which apply to both
GeoSeries
and
GeoDataFrame
objects. For more information on indexing/selecting, see the
pandas
documentation.
In addition to the standard
pandas
methods, GeoPandas also provides
coordinate based indexing with the
cx
indexer, which slices using a bounding
box. Geometries in the
GeoSeries
or
GeoDataFrame
that intersect the
bounding box will be returned.
Using the
geoda.chile_labor
dataset, you can use this functionality to quickly select parts
of Chile whose boundaries extend south of the -50 degrees latitude. You can first check the original GeoDataFrame.
In [1]:
import
geodatasets
In [2]:
chile
=
geopandas
.
read_file
(
geodatasets

get_path
(
'geoda.chile_labor'
))
In [3]:
chile
.
plot
(
figsize
=
(

,

));
And then select only the southern part of the country.
