Return a
GeoSeries
containing a simplified representation of
polygonal coverage.
Assumes that the
GeoSeries
forms a polygonal coverage. Under this
assumption, the method simplifies the edges using the Visvalingam-Whyatt
algorithm, while preserving a valid coverage. In the most simplified case,
polygons are reduced to triangles.
A
GeoSeries
of valid polygons is considered a coverage if the polygons are:
Non-overlapping
- polygons do not overlap (their interiors do not
intersect)
Edge-Matched
- vertices along shared edges are identical
The method allows simplification of all edges including the outer boundaries of
the coverage or simplification of only the inner (shared) edges.
If there are other geometry types than Polygons or MultiPolygons present, the
method will raise an error.
If the geometry is polygonal but does not form a valid coverage due to overlaps,
it will be simplified but it may result in invalid coverage topology.
Requires Shapely >= 2.1.
Added in version 1.1.0.
Parameters
:
tolerance
float
The degree of simplification roughly equal to the square root of the area
of triangles that will be removed. It has the same units
as the coordinate reference system of the GeoSeries.
For example, using
tolerance=100
in a projected CRS with meters
as units means a distance of 100 meters in reality.
simplify_boundary: bool (default True)
By default (True), simplifies both internal edges of the coverage as well
as its boundary. If set to False, only simplifies internal edges.
