#
Sample points from each geometry.
Generate a MultiPoint per each geometry containing points sampled from the
geometry. You can either sample randomly from a uniform distribution or use an
advanced sampling algorithm from the
pointpats
package.
For polygons, this samples within the area of the polygon. For lines,
this samples along the length of the linestring. For multi-part
geometries, the weights of each part are selected according to their relevant
attribute (area for Polygons, length for LineStrings), and then points are
sampled from each part.
Any other geometry type (e.g. Point, GeometryCollection) is ignored, and an
empty MultiPoint geometry is returned.
Parameters
:
size
int | array-like
The size of the sample requested. Indicates the number of samples to draw
from each geometry.  If an array of the same length as a GeoSeries is
passed, it denotes the size of a sample per geometry.
method
str, default “uniform”
The sampling method.
uniform
samples uniformly at random from a
geometry using
numpy.random.uniform
. Other allowed strings
(e.g.
"cluster_poisson"
) denote sampling function name from the
pointpats.random
module (see
http://pysal.org/pointpats/api.html#random-distributions
). Pointpats methods
are implemented for (Multi)Polygons only and will return an empty MultiPoint
for other geometry types.
rng
{None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence, BitGenerator, Generator}, optional
A random generator or seed to initialize the numpy BitGenerator. If None, then fresh,
unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS.
**kwargs
dict
Options for the pointpats sampling algorithms.
Returns
:
GeoSeries
Points sampled within (or along) each geometry.
