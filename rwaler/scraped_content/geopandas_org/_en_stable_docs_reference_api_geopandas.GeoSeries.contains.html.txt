#
Return a
Series
of
dtype('bool')
with value
True
for
each aligned geometry that contains
other
.
An object is said to contain
other
if at least one point of
other
lies in
the interior and no points of
other
lie in the exterior of the object.
(Therefore, any given polygon does not contain its own boundary - there is not
any point that lies in the interior.)
If either object is empty, this operation returns
False
.
This is the inverse of
within()
in the sense that the expression
a.contains(b)
==
b.within(a)
always evaluates to
True
.
The operation works on a 1-to-1 row-wise manner:
Parameters
:
other
GeoSeries or geometric object
The GeoSeries (elementwise) or geometric object to test if it
is contained.
align
bool | None (default None)
If True, automatically aligns GeoSeries based on their indices.
If False, the order of elements is preserved. None defaults to True.
Returns
:
Series (bool)

Notes
This method works in a row-wise manner. It does not check if an element
of one GeoSeries
contains
any
element of the other one.

4                       POINT (0 1)

We can check if each geometry of GeoSeries contains a single
geometry:
>>>
point
=
Point
(
0
,
1
)
>>>
s
.
contains
(
point
)
0    False
1     True
2    False
3     True
dtype: bool
We can also check two GeoSeries against each other, row by row.
The GeoSeries above have different indices. We can either align both GeoSeries
based on index values and compare elements with the same index using
align=True
or ignore index and compare elements based on their matching
order using
align=False
:
>>>
s2
.
contains
(
s
,
align
=
True
)
0    False
1    False
2    False
3     True
4    False
dtype: bool
>>>

(

)
1     True
