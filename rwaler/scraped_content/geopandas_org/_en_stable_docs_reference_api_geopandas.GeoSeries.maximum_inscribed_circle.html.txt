Return a
GeoSeries
of geometries representing the largest circle that
is fully contained within the input geometry.
Constructs the “maximum inscribed circle” (MIC) for a polygonal geometry, up to
a specified tolerance. The MIC is determined by a point in the interior of the
area which has the farthest distance from the area boundary, along with a
boundary point at that distance. In the context of geography the center of the
MIC is known as the “pole of inaccessibility”. A cartographic use case is to
determine a suitable point to place a map label within a polygon. The radius
length of the MIC is a measure of how “narrow” a polygon is. It is the distance
at which the negative buffer becomes empty.
The method supports polygons with holes and multipolygons but will raise an
error for any other geometry type.
Returns a GeoSeries with two-point linestrings rows, with the first point at the
center of the inscribed circle and the second on the boundary of the inscribed
circle.
Requires Shapely >= 2.1.
Added in version 1.1.0.
Parameters
:
tolerance
float, np.array, pd.Series
Stop the algorithm when the search area is smaller than this tolerance.
When not specified, uses
max(width,
height)
/
1000
per geometry as the
default. If np.array or pd.Series are used then it must have same length as
the GeoSeries.
