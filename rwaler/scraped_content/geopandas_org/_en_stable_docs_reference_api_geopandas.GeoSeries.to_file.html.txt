#
Write the
GeoSeries
to a file.
By default, an ESRI shapefile is written, but any OGR data source
supported by Pyogrio or Fiona can be written.
Parameters
:
filename
string
File path or file handle to write to. The path may specify a
GDAL VSI scheme.
driver
string, default None
The OGR format driver used to write the vector file.
If not specified, it attempts to infer it from the file extension.
If no extension is specified, it saves ESRI Shapefile to a folder.
index
bool, default None
If True, write index into one or more columns (for MultiIndex).
Default None writes the index into one or more columns only if
the index is named, is a MultiIndex, or has a non-integer data
type. If False, no index is written.
Added in version 0.7:
Previously the index was not written.
mode
string, default ‘w’
The write mode, ‘w’ to overwrite the existing file and ‘a’ to append.
Not all drivers support appending. The drivers that support appending
are listed in fiona.supported_drivers or
Toblerity/Fiona
crs
pyproj.CRS, default None
If specified, the CRS is passed to Fiona to
better control how the file is written. If None, GeoPandas
will determine the crs based on crs df attribute.
The value can be anything accepted
by
pyproj.CRS.from_user_input()
,
such as an authority string (eg “EPSG:4326”) or a WKT string. The keyword
is not supported for the “pyogrio” engine.
engine
str, “pyogrio” or “fiona”
The underlying library that is used to write the file. Currently, the
supported options are “pyogrio” and “fiona”. Defaults to “pyogrio” if
installed, otherwise tries “fiona”.
**kwargs
Keyword args to be passed to the engine, and can be used to write
to multi-layer data, store data within archives (zip files), etc.
In case of the “pyogrio” engine, the keyword arguments are passed to
pyogrio.write_dataframe
. In case of the “fiona” engine, the keyword
arguments are passed to fiona.open`. For more information on possible
keywords, type:
import
pyogrio;
help(pyogrio.write_dataframe)
.
