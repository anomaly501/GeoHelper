List layers available in a file.
Provides an overview of layers available in a file or URL together with their
geometry types. When supported by the data source, this includes both spatial and
non-spatial layers. Non-spatial layers are indicated by the
"geometry_type"
column being

a pd.DataFrame using
pyogrio.read_dataframe()
.
Parameters
:
filename
str, path object or file-like object
Either the absolute or relative path to the file or URL to
be opened, or any object with a read() method (such as an open file
or StringIO)
Returns

A DataFrame with columns “name” and “geometry_type” and one row per layer.
