#
Create an areal geometry formed by the constituent linework.
Builds areas from the GeoSeries that contain linework which represents the edges
of a planar graph. Any geometry type may be provided as input; only the
constituent lines and rings will be used to create the output polygons. All
geometries within the GeoSeries are considered together and the resulting
polygons therefore do not map 1:1 to input geometries.
This function converts inner rings into holes. To turn inner rings into polygons
as well, use polygonize.
Unless you know that the input GeoSeries represents a planar graph with a clean
topology (e.g. there is a node on both lines where they intersect), it is
recommended to use
node=True
which performs noding prior to building areal
geometry. Using
node=False
will provide performance benefits but may result
in incorrect polygons if the input is not of the proper topology.
If the input linework crosses, this function may produce invalid polygons. Use
GeoSeries.make_valid()
to ensure valid geometries.
Parameters
:
node
bool, default True
Perform noding prior to building the areas, by default True.
Returns
:
GeoSeries
GeoSeries with polygons
