#
Return the nearest geometry in the tree for each input geometry in
geometry
.
If multiple tree geometries have the same distance from an input geometry,
multiple results will be returned for that input geometry by default.
Specify
return_all=False
to only get a single nearest geometry
(non-deterministic which nearest is returned).
In the context of a spatial join, input geometries are the “left”
geometries that determine the order of the results, and tree geometries
are “right” geometries that are joined against the left geometries.
If
max_distance
is not set, this will effectively be a left join
because every geometry in
geometry
will have a nearest geometry in
the tree. However, if
max_distance
is used, this becomes an
inner join, since some geometries in
geometry
may not have a match
in the tree.
For performance reasons, it is highly recommended that you set
the
max_distance
parameter.
Parameters
:
geometry
{shapely.geometry, GeoSeries, GeometryArray, numpy.array of Shapely geometries}
A single shapely geometry, one of the GeoPandas geometry iterables
(GeoSeries, GeometryArray), or a numpy array of Shapely geometries to query
against the spatial index.
return_all
bool, default True
If there are multiple equidistant or intersecting nearest
geometries, return all those geometries instead of a single
nearest geometry.
max_distance
float, optional
Maximum distance within which to query for nearest items in tree.
Must be greater than 0. By default None, indicating no distance limit.
return_distance
bool, optional
If True, will return distances in addition to indexes. By default False
exclusive
bool, optional
if True, the nearest geometries that are equal to the input geometry
will not be returned. By default False.  Requires Shapely >= 2.0.
Returns
:
Indices or tuple of (indices, distances)
Indices is an ndarray of shape (2,n) and distances (if present) an
ndarray of shape (n).
The first subarray of indices contains input geometry indices.
The second subarray of indices contains tree geometry indices.
