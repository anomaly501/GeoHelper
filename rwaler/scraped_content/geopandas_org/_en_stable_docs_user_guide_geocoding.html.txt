Geocoding
#
GeoPandas supports geocoding (i.e., converting place names to
location on Earth) through
geopy
, an optional dependency of GeoPandas.
The following example shows how to get the
locations of boroughs in New York City, and plots those locations along
with the detailed borough boundary file included within GeoPandas.

By default, the
geocode()
function uses the
Photon geocoding API
.
But a different geocoding service can be specified with the
provider
keyword.
The argument to
provider
can either be a string referencing geocoding
services, such as
'google'
,
'bing'
,
'yahoo'
, and
'openmapquest'
, or an instance of a
Geocoder
from
geopy
. See
geopy.geocoders.SERVICE_TO_GEOCODER
for the full list.
For many providers, parameters such as API keys need to be passed as
**kwargs
in the
geocode()
call.
For example, to use the OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoder, you need to specify
a user agent:
geopandas
.
tools
.
geocode
(
boros
.
BoroName
,
provider
=
'nominatim'
,
user_agent
=
"my-application"
)
Attention
Please consult the Terms of Service for the chosen provider. The example
above uses
'photon'
(the default), which expects fair usage
- extensive usage will be throttled.
(
Photonâ€™s Terms of Use
).
