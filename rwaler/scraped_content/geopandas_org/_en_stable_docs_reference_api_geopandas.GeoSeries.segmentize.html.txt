)
[source]
#
Return a
GeoSeries
with vertices added to line segments based on
maximum segment length.
Additional vertices will be added to every line segment in an input geometry so
that segments are no longer than the provided maximum segment length. New
vertices will evenly subdivide each segment. Only linear components of input
geometries are densified; other geometries are returned unmodified.
Parameters
:
max_segment_length
float | array-like
Additional vertices will be added so that all line segments are no longer
than this value. Must be greater than 0.
Returns
:
GeoSeries
