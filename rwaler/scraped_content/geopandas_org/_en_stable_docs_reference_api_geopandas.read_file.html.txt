#
Return a GeoDataFrame from a file or URL.
Parameters
:
filename
str, path object or file-like object
Either the absolute or relative path to the file or URL to
be opened, or any object with a read() method (such as an open file
or StringIO)
bbox
tuple | GeoDataFrame or GeoSeries | shapely Geometry, default None
Filter features by given bounding box, GeoSeries, GeoDataFrame or a shapely
geometry. With engine=”fiona”, CRS mis-matches are resolved if given a GeoSeries
or GeoDataFrame. With engine=”pyogrio”, bbox must be in the same CRS as the
dataset. Tuple is (minx, miny, maxx, maxy) to match the bounds property of
shapely geometry objects. Cannot be used with mask.
mask
dict | GeoDataFrame or GeoSeries | shapely Geometry, default None
Filter for features that intersect with the given dict-like geojson
geometry, GeoSeries, GeoDataFrame or shapely geometry.
CRS mis-matches are resolved if given a GeoSeries or GeoDataFrame.
Cannot be used with bbox. If multiple geometries are passed, this will
first union all geometries, which may be computationally expensive.
columns
list, optional
List of column names to import from the data source. Column names
must exactly match the names in the data source. To avoid reading
any columns (besides the geometry column), pass an empty list-like.
By default reads all columns.
rows
int or slice, default None
Load in specific rows by passing an integer (first
n
rows) or a
slice() object.
engine
str,  “pyogrio” or “fiona”
The underlying library that is used to read the file. Currently, the
supported options are “pyogrio” and “fiona”. Defaults to “pyogrio” if
installed, otherwise tries “fiona”. Engine can also be set globally
with the
geopandas.options.io_engine
option.
**kwargs
Keyword args to be passed to the engine, and can be used to write
to multi-layer data, store data within archives (zip files), etc.
In case of the “pyogrio” engine, the keyword arguments are passed to
pyogrio.read_dataframe
. In case of the “fiona” engine, the keyword
arguments are passed to fiona.open`. For more information on possible
keywords, type:
import
pyogrio;
help(pyogrio.read_dataframe)
.
Returns
:
geopandas.GeoDataFrame
or
pandas.DataFrame
If
ignore_geometry=True
a
pandas.DataFrame
will be returned.
Notes
The format drivers will attempt to detect the encoding of your data, but
may fail. In this case, the proper encoding can be specified explicitly
by using the encoding keyword parameter, e.g.
encoding='utf-8'
.
For faster data reading with the default pyogrio engine when
pyarrow is installed, pass
use_arrow=True
as an argument. See the User
Guide page
Reading and writing files
for details.
When specifying a URL, geopandas will check if the server supports reading
partial data and in that case pass the URL as is to the underlying engine,
which will then use the network file system handler of GDAL to read from
the URL. Otherwise geopandas will download the data from the URL and pass
all data in-memory to the underlying engine.
If you need more control over how the URL is read, you can specify the
GDAL virtual filesystem manually (e.g.
/vsicurl/https://...
). See the
GDAL documentation on filesystems for more details
(
https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html#vsicurl-http-https-ftp-files-random-access
).
