Plot a GeoSeries.
Generate a plot of a GeoSeries geometry with matplotlib.
Parameters
:
s
Series
The GeoSeries to be plotted. Currently Polygon,
MultiPolygon, LineString, MultiLineString, Point and MultiPoint
geometries can be plotted.
cmap
str (default None)
The name of a colormap recognized by matplotlib. Any
colormap will work, but categorical colormaps are
generally recommended. Examples of useful discrete
colormaps include:
tab10, tab20, Accent, Dark2, Paired, Pastel1, Set1, Set2
color
str, np.array, pd.Series, List (default None)
If specified, all objects will be colored uniformly.
ax
matplotlib.pyplot.Artist (default None)
axes on which to draw the plot
figsize
pair of floats (default None)
Size of the resulting matplotlib.figure.Figure. If the argument
ax is given explicitly, figsize is ignored.
aspect
‘auto’, ‘equal’, None or float (default ‘auto’)
Set aspect of axis. If ‘auto’, the default aspect for map plots is ‘equal’; if
however data are not projected (coordinates are long/lat), the aspect is by
default set to 1/cos(s_y * pi/180) with s_y the y coordinate of the middle of
the GeoSeries (the mean of the y range of bounding box) so that a long/lat
square appears square in the middle of the plot. This implies an
Equirectangular projection. If None, the aspect of
ax
won’t be changed. It can
also be set manually (float) as the ratio of y-unit to x-unit.
autolim
bool (default True)
Update axes data limits to contain the new geometries.
**style_kwds
dict
Color options to be passed on to the actual plot function, such
as
edgecolor
,
facecolor
,
linewidth
,
markersize
,
alpha
.
