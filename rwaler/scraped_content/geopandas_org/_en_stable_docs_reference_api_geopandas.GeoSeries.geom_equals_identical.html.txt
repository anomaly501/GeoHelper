Return True for all geometries that are identical aligned

, else
False.
This function verifies whether geometries are pointwise equivalent by checking
that the structure, ordering, and values of all vertices are identical in all
dimensions.
Similarly to
geom_equals_exact()
, this function uses exact coordinate
equality and requires coordinates to be in the same order for all components
(vertices, rings, or parts) of a geometry. However, in contrast to
geom_equals_exact()
, this function does not allow specifying specify
a tolerance, and additionally requires all dimensions to be the same
(
geom_equals_exact()
ignores the Z and M dimensions), where NaN values
are considered to be equal to other NaN values.
This function is the vectorized equivalent of scalar equality of geometry
objects (
a
==
b
, i.e.
__eq__
).
The operation works on a 1-to-1 row-wise manner:
Requires Shapely >= 2.1.
Added in version 1.1.0.
Parameters
:
other
GeoSeries or geometric object
The GeoSeries (elementwise) or geometric object to compare to.
align
bool | None (default None)
If True, automatically aligns GeoSeries based on their indices.
If False, the order of elements is preserved. None defaults to True.
Returns
:
Series (bool)

Notes
This method works in a row-wise manner. It does not check if an element
of one GeoSeries is equal to
any
element of the other one.
