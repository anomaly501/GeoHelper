Return a
GeoSeries
containing a simplified representation of
each geometry.
The algorithm (Douglas-Peucker) recursively splits the original line
into smaller parts and connects these partsâ€™ endpoints
by a straight line. Then, it removes all points whose distance
to the straight line is smaller than
tolerance
. It does not
move any points and it always preserves endpoints of
the original line or polygon.
See
https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#object.simplify
for details
Simplifies individual geometries independently, without considering
the topology of a potential polygonal coverage. If you would like to treat
the
GeoSeries
as a coverage and simplify its edges, while preserving the
coverage topology, see
simplify_coverage()
.
Parameters
:
tolerance
float
All parts of a simplified geometry will be no more than
tolerance
distance from the original. It has the same units
as the coordinate reference system of the GeoSeries.
For example, using
tolerance=100
in a projected CRS with meters
as units means a distance of 100 meters in reality.
preserve_topology: bool (default True)
False uses a quicker algorithm, but may produce self-intersecting
or otherwise invalid geometries.

Notes
Invalid geometric objects may result from simplification that does not
preserve topology and simplification may be sensitive to the order of
coordinates: two geometries differing only in order of coordinates may be
simplified differently.
