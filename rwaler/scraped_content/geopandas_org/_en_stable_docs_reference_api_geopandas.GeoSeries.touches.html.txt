[source]
#
Return a
Series
of
dtype('bool')
with value
True
for
each aligned geometry that touches
other
.
An object is said to touch
other
if it has at least one point in
common with
other
and its interior does not intersect with any part
of the other. Overlapping features therefore do not touch.
The operation works on a 1-to-1 row-wise manner:
Parameters
:
other
GeoSeries or geometric object
The GeoSeries (elementwise) or geometric object to test if is
touched.
align
bool | None (default None)
If True, automatically aligns GeoSeries based on their indices.
If False, the order of elements is preserved. None defaults to True.
Returns
:
Series (bool)

GeoSeries.intersects
Notes
This method works in a row-wise manner. It does not check if an element
of one GeoSeries
touches
any
element of the other one.

We can check if each geometry of GeoSeries touches a single
geometry:
>>>
line
=
LineString
([(
0
,
0
),
(
-
1
,
-
2
)])
>>>
s
.
touches
(
line
)
0    True
1    True
2    True
3    True
dtype: bool
We can also check two GeoSeries against each other, row by row.
The GeoSeries above have different indices. We can either align both GeoSeries
based on index values and compare elements with the same index using
align=True
or ignore index and compare elements based on their matching
order using
align=False
:
>>>

0    False
1     True
