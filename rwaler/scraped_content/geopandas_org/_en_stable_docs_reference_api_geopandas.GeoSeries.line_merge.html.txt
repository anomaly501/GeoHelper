#
Return (Multi)LineStrings formed by combining the lines in a
MultiLineString.
Lines are joined together at their endpoints in case two lines are intersecting.
Lines are not joined when 3 or more lines are intersecting at the endpoints.
Line elements that cannot be joined are kept as is in the resulting
MultiLineString.
The direction of each merged LineString will be that of the majority of the
LineStrings from which it was derived. Except if
directed=True
is specified,
then the operation will not change the order of points within lines and so only
lines which can be joined with no change in direction are merged.
Non-linear geometeries result in an empty GeometryCollection.
Parameters
:
directed
bool, default False
Only combine lines if possible without changing point order.
Requires GEOS >= 3.11.0
Returns
:
GeoSeries

With
directed=True
, you can avoid changing the order of points within lines
and merge only lines where no change of direction is required:
>>>
s
.
line_merge
(
directed
=
True
)
