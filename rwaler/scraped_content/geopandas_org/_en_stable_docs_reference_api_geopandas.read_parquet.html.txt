#
Load a Parquet object from the file path, returning a GeoDataFrame.
You can read a subset of columns in the file using the
columns
parameter.
However, the structure of the returned GeoDataFrame will depend on which
columns you read:
if no geometry columns are read, this will raise a
ValueError
- you
should use the pandas
read_parquet
method instead.
if the primary geometry column saved to this file is not included in
columns, the first available geometry column will be set as the geometry
column of the returned GeoDataFrame.
Supports versions 0.1.0, 0.4.0 and 1.0.0 of the GeoParquet
specification at:
opengeospatial/geoparquet
If ‘crs’ key is not present in the GeoParquet metadata associated with the
Parquet object, it will default to “OGC:CRS84” according to the specification.
Requires ‘pyarrow’.
Added in version 0.8.
Parameters
:
path
str, path object
columns
list-like of strings, default=None
If not None, only these columns will be read from the file.  If
the primary geometry column is not included, the first secondary
geometry read from the file will be set as the geometry column
of the returned GeoDataFrame.  If no geometry columns are present,
a
ValueError
will be raised.
storage_options
dict, optional
Extra options that make sense for a particular storage connection, e.g. host,
port, username, password, etc. For HTTP(S) URLs the key-value pairs are
forwarded to urllib as header options. For other URLs (e.g. starting with
“s3://”, and “gcs://”) the key-value pairs are forwarded to fsspec. Please
see fsspec and urllib for more details.
When no storage options are provided and a filesystem is implemented by
both
pyarrow.fs
and
fsspec
(e.g. “s3://”) then the
pyarrow.fs
filesystem is preferred. Provide the instantiated fsspec filesystem using
the
filesystem
keyword if you wish to use its implementation.
bbox
tuple, optional
Bounding box to be used to filter selection from geoparquet data. This
is only usable if the data was saved with the bbox covering metadata.
Input is of the tuple format (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax).
to_pandas_kwargs
dict, optional
Arguments passed to the
pa.Table.to_pandas
method for non-geometry columns.
This can be used to control the behavior of the conversion of the non-geometry
columns to a pandas DataFrame. For example, you can use this to control the
dtype conversion of the columns. By default, the
to_pandas
method is called
with no additional arguments.
**kwargs
Any additional kwargs passed to
pyarrow.parquet.read_table()
.
Returns
:
GeoDataFrame
